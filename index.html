<h1>Grammys 2026: Bad Bunny Makes History</h1>

<p>
Now to some <span class="word" title="浮华与魅力；奢华感">glitz and glamour</span> from this year’s Grammy Awards. 
Bad Bunny made history by <span class="word" title="赢得；斩获（奖项）">scooping</span> the Album of the Year prize. 
It is the first Spanish-language album ever to win the top award on music’s biggest night.
</p>

<p>
Other big winners included Kendrick Lamar, Lady Gaga and Billie Eilish. 
Britain’s Olivia Dean was crowned <span class="word" title="获得称号；被加冕为">Best New Artist</span>.
</p>

<p>
Several artists also used the event to voice their opposition to President Trump’s 
<span class="word" title="严厉的；强硬的">crackdown</span> on immigration.
</p>

<p>
First, David Willis reports from Los Angeles.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
The rock version of Rosé and Bruno Mars’ hit song “APT” got music’s biggest night off to a 
<span class="word" title="充满活力的；动感的">dynamic</span> start.
</p>

<p>
Kendrick Lamar collected the 26th Grammy of his career for his album “GNX”, 
marking the beginning of a <span class="word" title="具有历史意义的">history-making</span> night.
</p>

<p>
Barely had Olivia Dean finished performing her first UK number-one hit “Man I Need” 
when she was called back on stage.
The 26-year-old used an emotional acceptance speech to address the 
<span class="word" title="棘手的；敏感的">thorny</span> issue of immigration.
</p>

<p>
“I am a product of bravery,” she said. “And I think those people deserve to be celebrated.”
</p>

<p>
Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny went even further, 
<span class="word" title="强烈谴责">condemning</span> the actions of US immigration agents before going on to win the top award of the night.
</p>

<p>
“We are not savages. We are not animals. We are not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans,” he said.
</p>

<p>
Another first-time British winner, Lola Young, could hardly 
<span class="word" title="控制；抑制">contain</span> her excitement.
Her acceptance speech mirrored the title of her hit song.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t have a speech prepared,” she laughed. “I know — it’s messy.”
</p>

<p>
Cher announced the Record of the Year winner, Kendrick Lamar, 
but briefly <span class="word" title="搞混；混淆">confused</span> the name of the song with the artist.
</p>

<p>
However, the night ultimately belonged to Bad Bunny — the first Latin artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year.
He dedicated the award to those who had left their homeland to follow their dreams.
</p>

<h2>Analysis & Themes</h2>

<p>
Speaking to the BBC, music journalist and broadcaster Mary Mandelfield said the night was deeply political.
Many artists, she explained, felt a responsibility to use their platform during a 
<span class="word" title="分裂的；对立的">divisive</span> time.
</p>

<p>
“There is no longer a clear separation between music and politics,” she said.
“Artists are under pressure — both from fans and from themselves — to speak out.”
</p>

<p>
British artists also had a strong showing, with wins across pop, electronic and rock categories,
highlighting the global <span class="word" title="影响力；影响范围">impact</span> of UK music.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the awards, the night was also a celebration of fashion and 
<span class="word" title="自我表达">self-expression</span>, with artists using style as another way to communicate their identity and beliefs.
